Binghamton University 

  * Instructor: Vladislav Kargin
  * Office: WH-136
  * Meeting time and location: MWF 8:00 - 9:30 am at CW 212.

studying for tests and examinations, preparing written assignments, completing internship or
clinical placement requirements, and other tasks that must be completed to earn credit in the 
course. **

=== Prerequisite ===

  * A grade of C or better in Math 323




=== Description ===

This is an introductory course that will cover basic combinatorial probability and essential tools of modern probability, including mathematical expectation, probability conditioning,  moments and moment generating function. It will discuss common discrete and continuous distributions, multivariate distributions and some limit theorems. It is prerequisite course for Math 448 (the statistics half of the sequence) and several other actuarial/statistics courses. The learning outcome is the ability to work with probability tools necessary for these courses.

  * “Mathematical Statistics with Applications” by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer
We will cover Chapters 2-7. Electronic copy will be made available. I will also provide  a set of lecture notes mostly based on this book.
