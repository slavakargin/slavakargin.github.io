course. **

=== Prerequisite ===

  * A grade of C or better in Math 323




=== Description ===

This is an introductory course that will cover basic combinatorial probability and essential tools of modern probability, including mathematical expectation, probability conditioning,  moments and moment generating function. It will discuss common discrete and continuous distributions, multivariate distributions and some limit theorems. It is prerequisite course for Math 448 (the statistics half of the sequence) and several other actuarial/statistics courses. The learning outcome is the ability to work with probability tools necessary for these courses. 



=== Recommended Texts ===

  * “Introduction to Probability”, 2nd edition, by Blitzstein and Hwang. 
We will cover Chapters 1-10.
